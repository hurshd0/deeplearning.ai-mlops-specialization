# Deeplearning.AI's ML Ops Specialization on Coursera

This repository contains my personal notes and summaries on ![DeepLearning.ai;s MLOps specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops/) courses.

## Who is this course for?

Machine Learning Engineers, boot camp graduates, or college graduates looking to expand their knowledge beyond just `model.fit` and learn tools, and techniques to gain practical experience when it comes to productionizing ML models beyond research environment. 

## Course Highlights

- Desingning an ML production system end-to-end from:
  - Project Scoping
  - Data requirements
  - Modeling strategies
  - Deployment requirements

- Building data pipelines by gathering, cleaning, and validating datasets (aka Data Engineering skills). Establishing data lifecycle by using data lineage and provenance metadata tools.
- Establishing model baseline, addresing model drift, and prototyping how to develop, deploy, and continuously improve a productionzed ML application.
- Apply best practices and progressively delivering techniques to maintain and monitor a continously  operating production system.

## Course Notes & Notebooks
